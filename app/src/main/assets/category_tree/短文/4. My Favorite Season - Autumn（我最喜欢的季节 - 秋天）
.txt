Autumn is my favorite season of the year. It is a season of harvest and beauty.
When autumn comes, the leaves on the trees turn into various colors, like red, yellow, and orange. They look like beautiful butterflies fluttering in the air as they fall to the ground. Walking on the carpet of fallen leaves, I can hear the soft rustling sound, which is like a gentle lullaby.
Autumn is also a season of delicious fruits. Apples are red and juicy, pears are yellow and sweet, and grapes are purple and plump. Farmers are busy harvesting their crops in the fields. The air is filled with the sweet smell of fruits and grains.
The weather in autumn is very pleasant. It is neither too hot nor too cold. The cool breeze makes me feel energetic. I often go on hikes in the mountains during this season. Standing on the top of the mountain, I can enjoy the magnificent view of the autumn scenery.
In short, autumn is a wonderful season that combines beauty, harvest, and comfort. I love everything about it.
